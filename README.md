## Introduction

This README file provides information about the Redux WebSocket Toggle Project. The project is designed to demonstrate the use of Redux and WebSocket to create a real-time toggle functionality that synchronizes state across multiple users or tabs.

## Features

- Toggle functionality that updates state across multiple users or tabs.
- Internal communication and event transfer between different tabs of the application.
- Redux for state management.
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js and npm: You can download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/redux-websocket-toggle-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd redux-websocket-toggle-project
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
  - `actions/`: Redux action creators.
  - `components/`: React components.
  - `reducers/`: Redux reducers.
  - `sockets/`: WebSocket integration.
  - `store/`: Redux store configuration.
  - `App.js`: Main application component.
- `public/`: Static assets and HTML template.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Usage

### Toggle Functionality

The main functionality of this project is the toggle button. When a user clicks the toggle button in one tab, the same toggle state will be synchronized with all other tabs open for the application. This demonstrates real-time state synchronization using Redux and WebSocket.

### Internal Communication

The application also showcases internal communication and event transfer between different tabs or users. Events triggered in one tab will be communicated to other tabs in real-time. You can use this feature to demonstrate how different parts of the application can interact with each other across tabs.

## Redux Store

Redux is used for state management in this project. The Redux store is configured in the `store/` directory, and actions and reducers are defined in their respective directories (`actions/` and `reducers/`). Make sure to follow Redux best practices when adding or modifying state-related logic.

## WebSocket Integration

WebSocket integration is used to enable real-time communication between different instances of the application. The WebSocket code can be found in the `sockets/` directory. You can configure the WebSocket server endpoint and connection logic in this section.
